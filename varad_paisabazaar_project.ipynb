        "For this project, the goal was to analyze customer data from Paisabazaar to uncover patterns and potential red flags that might indicate banking fraud. The dataset included 100,000 records with 28 different attributes, covering key details about customers' financial habits, credit history, and loan information. Some of the important features examined were Age, SSN, Occupation, Annual Income, Credit Utilization Ratio, Payment Behavior, and Credit Score. By studying these factors, we aimed to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and identify any irregularities that could suggest fraudulent activity.\n",

        "errors or inconsistencies, we began by cleaning and organizing the dataset.This included handling missing values, fixing incorrect data types, and ensuring uniformity across different columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We used various visualization techniques to understand the relationships between different features, spot trends, and get a better sense of the overall data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature Engineering:** To enhance our analysis, we created new variables and modified existing ones to make fraud detection more effective. This helped us capture subtle patterns that might not be obvious in raw data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outlier Detection:** Certain behaviors—like excessively high credit utilization, large outstanding debts, or frequent delayed payments—can be signs of potential fraud. We focused on identifying these unusual patterns to flag risky profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Credit Score Analysis:** We examined how credit scores varied across different occupations and customer profiles, looking for any suspicious trends. A low or abnormal credit score could be an indicator of financial instability or fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Loan and Payment Behavior:** By analyzing different types of loans, the number of delayed payments, and overall payment habits, we aimed to spot inconsistencies that could point toward fraudulent activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this analysis, we were able to gain a clearer picture of potential fraud risks within the dataset, which could be valuable for financial institutions looking to strengthen their fraud detection mechanisms."
